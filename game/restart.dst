# Internationalization stuff
# Set LANG here to get international character sets and, if someone's
# done it, translation of messages.
# Vaild locales are usually <lang_code>_<COUNTRY CODE>
# Example (uncomment to use):
#LANG=fr_FR

# Time zone stuff
# If you want your MUSH to run in a different timezone than the one
# you're in, you need to identify the target time zone file in 
# /usr/share/zoneinfo or /usr/lib/zoneinfo. Then uncomment the next
# two lines and set TZ to the desired timezone file, as shown, with
# an initial colon:
#TZ=:EST5EDT
#export TZ
