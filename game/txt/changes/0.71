CobraMUSH Version 0.71
  This is a list of changes in CobraMUSH that could be of
  interest to the user.
  (changes entries for list all versions.)

  Minor Change:
     * Version numbering changed, '-' will no longer preceed
       maintenance patches, they will be preceeded by p.
       This will allow easier migration of CobraMUSH to
       debian packages.
     * Began using vim folding on certain source files
     * Jeremy Ritter's MUSHCron is now being used in replacement
       of @hourly & @daily.  However hourly & daily,  still work 
       as default global crontab entries.
     * MUSH now auto-detects your connection for what type of
       @prompt your connection can handle.  'WeirdPrompt's flag
       no longer used as an affect of this.
     * Global Attribute Locks are now possible as well as a catchall
       attribute for any non-standard attribute.
  Commands:
     * @program now accepts the the format of @program obj=atr
       to default to the executing object the attribute  is on.
     * @program no longer handles a prompt, @prompt must be used
       instead.
     * @attribute/lock, @attribute/write, added todo apart of global
       attribuet locking.
  Configuration:
     * Guest prefix moved to a config file option
     * Option to use roman numeral numbering of guests 
       given.
     * Default Player Powergroup configuration option added.
  Functions:
     * program() no longer handles prompts, prompt() must be used.
     * arabic2roman() converts arabic numbers to roman numerals.
     * roman2arabic() converts roman numeral characters to
       arabic characters.
     * pghaspower(), and pgpowers() functions added.
     * powergroups() with no arguments now gives the equivalent of
       @powergroups/list
  Helpfiles:
     * documented @prompt, prompt(), pghaspower(), and pgpowers()
     * modified @program, and powergroups() helpfiles for new syntaxes
  Fixes:
     * ooref overwrite bug in process_expressoin
     * Deleting a powergroup that exists on a player would
       crash the game.
     * Newly created databases would create the master division
       twice.
     * Attributes weren't being cloned correctly.
     * Deleting powers when a powergroup had no powers would crash
       the game.
