Bugs that aren't our fault, but might bite people with old compilers:

* Ralph Melton reports that compiling with gcc 2.5.8 under SunOS 4.1.1
  using -O optimization and forking dumps causes the dump process to
  crash. Removing -O fixes the problem; so might using a more recent gcc.
* Javelin has confirmed that compiling with gcc 2.7.2.3 under Linux 2.2.16
  using -O optimization causes ansi(rh,a) to crash. Removing -O fixes
  the problem; so might using a more recent gcc
